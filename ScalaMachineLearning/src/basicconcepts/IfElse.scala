// The If.. Else expression is a classical programming construct for choosing a branch of code based on whether an expression resolves to true or false.
//match expressions are akin to C's and JAva's "switch" statements, where a single input item is evaluated and the first pattern that is matched is executed and its value returned.
//<expression> match {
 // case <pattern match> => <expression>
//[case...]
